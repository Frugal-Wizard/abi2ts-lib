## What is this?

This is a library used by code generated by [abi2ts](https://github.com/TheOrderbookDEX/abi2ts).

Basically, you need [abi2ts](https://github.com/TheOrderbookDEX/abi2ts) as a devDependency to build the code, and this library as a normal dependency for the code to work.

## Should I use this?

Currently it's not to be considered stable.

Use at your own discretion and don't rely on its interface staying backward compatible.
